using cnn algorithm to detection of multi spectral camera image and see reflectance of object. 

Image classification is performed through the cnn algorithm.
cnnclassificationaction2.mat is used as an algorithm code for executing the cnn algorithm.

Image processing zip is a process of aggregating multi-spectral images that have been aligned 
Each process is written separately in code.

The lee_rededge_alignment.zip utilizes the rededge, a multi-spectral camera 
A total of 10 bands taken are aligned to one picture.
